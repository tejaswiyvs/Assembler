# Assembler
A collection of assembly snippets written while learning assembly.

Syntax will be the AT&T asm syntax, and the assembler is GAS.
I don't have a technical reason right now for chosing AT&T assembly syntax
over Intel. I actually think Intel's syntax is more intuitive, but I just happen
to have some existing code written to work with GAS, so might as well.
